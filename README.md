# CS230 - Module Eight Journal

> Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was the client. They wanted to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their existing Android game, Draw It or Lose It.

> What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I felt that my explanations for my storage management explanation was thorough and hit on what would probably be the most important part for developing this application.

> What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

There was no further coding beyond module four and this design document was not particularly useful for most of it. Perhaps the design constraints portion was the only useful part. However, I would imagine that coding would continue and this document would help to guide platform decisions through the final recommendations.

> If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part I would revise would be the development requirements section. I would probably elaborate more on the Linux server-side portion to highlight more of the features, especially since I ended up recommending that in the end.

> How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The client explained the game's function and what was expected, which I then collected and summarized in the first few sections of the document. Their needs were implemented modularly based on function, which ensures easier understanding and maintenance of the program. It is critically essential to consider the user’s needs when designing since that is what drives their expectations of your work.

> How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The module work guided us very linearly, so it's not like I made any design decisions with the software beyond the final recommendations. Having a design template could help sharpen the focus on completing application development as it helps in making the preliminary decisions that would be necessary before coding.
